### What can I back up?
---

By default, `shallow-backup` backs these up.

1. `dotfiles` and `dotfolders`.
    * `.bashrc`
    * `.bash_profile`
    * `.gitconfig`
    * `.pypirc`
    * `.shallow-backup`
    * `.ssh/`
    * `.vim/`
    * `.zshrc`

2. Application Preferences
    * Atom
    * Sublime Text
    * Terminal
    * JetBrains IDEs
    * VS Code (Coming soon!)

3. Installed `packages`.
    * `Atom` Packages (`apm`)
    * `brew` and `cask`
    * `cargo`
    * `gem`
    * `pip`
    * `npm`
    * `macports`
    * `Sublime Text` Packages
    * `~/Applications/` directory

4. User installed `fonts`.

But you can add/remove whatever you want by modifying the `~/.shallow-backup` config file. The ability to modify this file from the CLI is coming soon!

### Installation
---

1. Install with [`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/shallow-backup/)
    + `$ pip install shallow-backup`
    + `$ shallow-backup`

2. Download the `shallow-backup` binary from Releases tab.

### Usage
---

```shell
Usage: shallow_backup.py [OPTIONS]

  Easily back up installed packages, dotfiles, and more.
  You can edit which dotfiles are backed up in ~/.shallow-backup.

Options:
  -complete            Back up everything.
  -dotfiles            Back up dotfiles.
  -configs             Back up app config files.
  -fonts               Back up installed fonts.
  -packages            Back up package libraries and installed applications.
  -old_path            Skip setting new back up directory path.
  --new_path TEXT      Input a new back up directory path.
  --remote TEXT        Input a URL for a git repository.
  -reinstall_packages  Reinstall packages from package lists.
  -reinstall_configs   Reinstall configs from configs backup.
  -delete_config       Remove config file.
  -v                   Display version and author information and exit.
  -destroy_backup      Removes the backup directory and its content.
  -h, -help, --help    Show this message and exit.
```

NOTE: `shallow-backup` works best when it's populating an empty directory.

#### Example Commands
---

```shell
$ shallow-backup # Launch interactive CLI backup process
$ shallow-backup -old_path -complete # Make complete backup using same path as in config file
$ shallow-backup -new_path new_backup_dir -fonts # Back up fonts using path: `/new_backup_dir/`
```

#### Use Cases
---

1. Reduce your backup size by compressing all package manager libraries to simple `.txt` files.
2. Easily back up your dotfiles.
3. Back up all user installed `.ttf` and `.otf` fonts from `Fontbook`.
4. Back up application preferences of Terminal and Sublime.

### Inspiration
---

I back up system images of my MacBook Pro to an external SSD multiple times per week, and it always takes way too long. I wanted to speed this up, so I took a look at *what was actually being backed up*. I saw that my `brew`, `npm`, and `pip` libraries took up way more memory than I imagined.

*And it's totally unnecessary!* All you really need to "back up" your package installs is a list of the installed packages from each package manager. If you have these lists, restoring your system package installs is easy: `$ pip install -r pip_list.txt`, for example. Additionally, you have the added bonus of always installing up-to-date packages after an OS wipe and reinstall.

I cut down my backup size by almost `10GB` by replacing my `pip`, `brew`, `brew cask` and `npm` install libraries with simple text files, also cutting down the back up time significantly.

Once I'd built that functionality, I wanted to have a single backup utility for files and folders often used by developers, so I added the ability to backup `dotfiles` and `fonts`. (Note: Because just having a list of installed fonts or a list of dotfiles that exist isn't very useful, `shallow-backup` creates copies of all dotfiles and user installed fonts.)
